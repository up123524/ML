# ML
ML projects I have worked on to practise and expand my skills in this area. This has been instrumental in increasing my understanding and intuition of use cases for certain methods such as sampling methods to improve performance over biased data sets. 

I have uploaded a few test files as I like to document my first forays into areas, first so I have everything saved in case I need to access it again if needed, sometimes a test becomes a project. Secondly as a measure of how far I've come!
